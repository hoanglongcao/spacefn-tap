SpaceFN for Linux with tapping for dedicated arrow keys

SpaceFN-Tap is adapted from [abrasive/spacefn-evdev](https://github.com/abrasive/spacefn-evdev) with tapping for dedicated arrow keys inspired from [Anne Pro 2](https://medium.com/@thomaz.moura/how-the-anne-pro-2-mechanical-keyboard-completely-changed-my-workflow-e795f1f62026).

# Tapping function

I used KEY_RIGHTSHIFT, KEY_COMPOSE, KEY_RIGHTALT and KEY_RIGHTCTRL for UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT. These keys should work with their normal functionalities when being pressed and held.
